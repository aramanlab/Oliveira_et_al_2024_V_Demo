- The PCA components used in the notebooks in this folder were obtained from the Real Data set.
- The PCA coordinates are in the Dataset folder.
- The Real Datasets contain:
      1. the strain presence-absence vs KP CFU for all the original 96 experiments
      2. the strain presence-absence vs KP CFU for the 60 out-of-sample experiments
      2. the metabolite Z score vs KP CFU for 81 of 96 original experiments
      3. the metabolite Z score vs KP CFU for the 60 out-of-sample experiments
      

  
- These datasets will be open source upon publication or available upon request.
